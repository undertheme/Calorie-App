# Calorie-App
CalorieAI is an AI-powered app that estimates the calories of food from images using state-of-the-art vision-language models and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Built on top of the Food-101 dataset, this project combines deep learning, LLMs, and nutritional science into a complete end-to-end pipeline.
